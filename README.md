The purpose of this project is to reproduce a published work in bioinformatics. we selected "GAN-WGCNA: Calculating gene modules to identify key intermediate regulators in cocaine addiction." This study stood out for its innovative integration of Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)—two well-established but distinct computational techniques. The combination of these methods offers a powerful approach to uncovering gene expression patterns linked to phenotypic traits, making it an exciting case study in applying machine learning to biological data. The study’s focus on cocaine addiction was particularly compelling, as it demonstrates how computational methods can enhance our understanding of complex disorders with genetic components. A key factor in our decision was the study’s transparency and accessibility. The authors provided both the dataset and analysis scripts, which are well-structured and documented. This ensures a clearer path for our reproducibility study and allows us to critically examine and validate their findings without unnecessary roadblocks related to missing or proprietary data.
